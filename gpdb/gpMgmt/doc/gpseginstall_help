COMMAND NAME:  gpseginstall

Installs Greenplum Database on segment hosts.


*****************************************************
SYNOPSIS
*****************************************************

gpseginstall -f host_file [-u user] [-p password] 
             [-c [u|p|c|s|E|e|l|v]]

gpseginstall --help 


*****************************************************
DESCRIPTION
*****************************************************

The gpseginstall utility provides a simple way to quickly install Greenplum 
Database on segment hosts that you specify in a host list file. The utility 
does not install or update Greenplum Database on the master host. You can 
run gpseginstall as root or as a non-root user. gpseginstall does not perform 
database initialization. See gpinitsystem for more information about 
initializing Greenplum Database.

When run as root, gpseginstall default actions are to add a system user 
(default is gpadmin), create a password (default is changeme), and deploy and 
install Greenplum Database on segment hosts. To do this, gpseginstall locates 
the current Greenplum Database binaries on the master from the installation 
path in the current user’s environment variables ($GPHOME). It compresses 
Greenplum Database software into a tar.gz file and performs an MD5 checksum 
to verify file integrity. 

Then, it copies Greenplum Database to the segment hosts, installs 
(decompresses) Greenplum Database, and changes the ownership of the Greenplum 
Database installation to the system user you specify with the -u option. 
Lastly, it exchanges keys between all Greenplum Database hosts as both root 
and as the system user you specify with the -u option. gpseginstall also perform 
a user limit check and verifies the version number of Greenplum Database on all 
the segments.

If you run gpseginstall as a non-root user, gpseginstall only compresses, copies, 
and installs Greenplum Database on segment hosts. It can also exchanges keys 
between Greenplum Database hosts for the current system user, and verifies the 
version number of Greenplum Database on all the segments.

OPTIONS
*****************************************************

-c | --commands command_option(s)

This allows you to customize gpseginstall actions. Note that these command 
options are executed by default if you do not specify the -c option in the 
gpseginstall syntax.

    * u: Adds a system user. (root only)

    * p: Changes the password for a system user. (root only)

    * s: Compresses, copies, decompresses (installs) Greenplum Database on all 
         segments.
 
    * c: Changes the ownership of the Greenplum Database installation directory on 
         the segment hosts. (root only)

    * E: Exchange keys between Greenplum Database master and segment hosts for the 
         root user. (root only)

    * e: Exchange keys between Greenplum Database master and segment hosts for the 
         non-root system user. 

    * l: (Linux only) Checks and modifies the user limits configuration file 
         (/etc/security/limits.conf file) when adding a new user to segment hosts. 
         (root only)

    * v: Verifies the version of Greenplum Database running on all segments. 
         gpseginstall checks the version number of the Greenplum Database 
         installation referenced by the $GPHOME environment variable and symbolic 
         link to the installation directory. An error occurs if there is a version 
         number mismatch or the Greenplum Database installation directory cannot be 
         found.


-f | --file host_file

This option is required. This specifies the file that lists the segment hosts 
onto which you want to install Greenplum Database.

The host list file must have one host name per line and includes a host name 
for each segment host in your Greenplum system. Make sure there are no blank 
lines or extra spaces. If a host has multiple configured host names, use only 
one host name per host. For example:

sdw1-1
sdw2-1
sdw3-1
sdw4-1

If available, you can use the same gpssh-exkeys host list file you used to 
exchange keys between Greenplum Database hosts.


-p | --password password

This sets the password for the user you specify with the -u option. The 
default password is changeme. This option is only available when you run 
gpseginstall as root.

Best practises: Always use passwords, do not use default passwords, 
change default passwords immediately after installation.


-u | --user user

This specifies the system user. This user is also the Greenplum Database 
administrative user. This user owns Greenplum Database installation and 
administers the database. This is also the user under which Greenplum 
Database is started/initialized. This option is only available when you run 
gpseginstall as root. The default is gpadmin. 


--help (help)

Displays the online help.


*****************************************************
EXAMPLES
*****************************************************

As root, install a Greenplum Database on all segments, leave the system user 
as the default (gpadmin) and set the gpadmin password to secret123:

$ gpseginstall -f my_host_list_file -p secret123

As a non-root user, compress and copy Greenplum Database binaries to all 
segments (as gpadmin)

$ gpseginstall -f host_file

As root, add a user (gpadmin2), set the password for the user (secret1234), 
exchange keys between hosts as the new user, check user limits, and verify 
version numbers, but do not change ownership of Greenplum binaries, 
compress/copy/ install Greenplum Database on segments, or exchange keys as 
root.

$ gpseginstall -f host_file -u gpadmin2 -p secret1234 -c upelv
