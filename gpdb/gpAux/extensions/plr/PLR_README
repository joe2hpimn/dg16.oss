ABOUT PL/R AND R IN GREENPLUM DATABASE
************************************************************************

PL/R is a PostGreSQL language extension that allows you to write PostgreSQL 
functions and aggregate functions in the R statistical computing language.
In order to use PL/R in Greenplum Database, you must install the PL/R library
file on every host in your Greenplum Database array. More information on PL/R 
is available at: http://www.joeconway.com/plr/

R is a programming language and environment for statistical computing and
graphics. R is available as Free Software under the terms of the 
Free Software Foundation's GNU General Public License in source code form. 
Greenplum has compiled and packaged the basic R distribution for users who
wish to write user-defined database functions in PL/R (the PostgreSQL R
procedural language). In order to use PL/R functions, R must be installed on
every host in your Greenplum Database array. More information on R is available 
on the R Project website: http://www.r-project.org/


***************************************************
INSTALLING AND ENABLING PL/R IN GREENPLUM DATABASE
***************************************************

1. To use PL/R. you must have R installed on all Greenplum hosts 
   (see instructions below).

2. Obtain the greenplum-db-<version>-plr-<platform>.zip distribution 
   package from Greenplum customer support.

3. Unzip the package, for example:

    $ unzip greenplum-db-<version>-plr-<platform>.zip

4. Copy the plr.so file to $GPHOME/lib/postgresql on all hosts:

    $ gpscp -f <all_hosts_file> ./greenplum-db-<version>-plr/plr.so =:/usr/local/greenplum-db-<version>/lib/postgresql

  (Solaris Only) Also copy the libgcc_s.so.1 and libiconv.so.2 files 
                 to $GPHOME/lib on all hosts. 

5. Make sure $R_HOME is set on all Greenplum hosts:

    $ gpssh -f <all_hosts_file> -e "echo $R_HOME"

6. Restart Greenplum Database:

    $ gpstop -r

7. Enable PL/R in your database(s). Enabling PL/R in the template1 
   database will also enable PL/R in any new databases you create.

    $ psql template1 -c "CREATE LANGUAGE plr;"
   
    $ psql <database_name> -c "CREATE LANGUAGE plr;" 

NOTE: If the CREATE LANGUAGE command does not succeed because a
      library (.so file) could not be found, you may need to update
      your $LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable on all Greenplum
      hosts so that the libraries for R are searched first. For example, 
      add the following line to the 'gpadmin' .bashrc on all hosts
      after your setting for R_HOME:
      
       export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$R_HOME/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

      Then restart your Greenplum Database system:

       gpstop -r


***************************************************
INSTALLING R FOR USE WITH GREENPLUM DATABASE
***************************************************

NOTE: You will need root access to install R.

1. Obtain the compiled R-<version>-<platform>.zip distribution package 
   from Greenplum customer support.

2. Unzip the package:

    $ unzip R-2.6.1-<platform>.zip

3. Run the following script to modify the installation path for R. 
   R should be installed in the system shared library location, which
   varies among the supported platforms
 
   Solaris 64-bit		/usr/lib/64/R-2.6.1 
   RHEL 64-bit		/usr/lib64/R-2.6.1
   RHEL 32-bit   		/usr/lib/R-2.6.1
   SLES 64-bit          /usr/lib64/R-2.6.1
   
   For example, to modify the installation path on RHEL5 64-bit (all examples
   in this document reflect 64-bit Linux; make sure you use the correct path
   for your environment):

    $ ./modify-R-startup-path.sh /usr/lib64/R-2.6.1


4. As root, copy the R installation to the correct location on the 
   master:

    # cp -R R-2.6.1 /usr/lib64

5. Using gpscp, copy the R installation to the correct location on the 
   segment hosts:

    # gpscp -rf <seg_hosts_file> /usr/lib64/R-2.6.1 =:/usr/lib


6. Set the R_HOME environment variable on all hosts in your Greenplum 
   array. This must be set for the 'gpadmin' user on all hosts. For example,
   modify the .bashrc file of the 'gpadmin' user on all hosts 
   and add a line like the following:
   
    export R_HOME=/usr/lib64/R-2.6.1/lib64/R
 

7. The R libraries must be findable by your runtime linker. On Linux, 
   this involves adding a configuration file for libR in 
   /etc/ld.so.conf.d and then running ldconfig. For example (as root):

   # echo "$R_HOME/lib" > /etc/ld.so.conf.d/libR-2.6.1.conf
   # /sbin/ldconfig

   On Solaris, this involves running crle and adding the path for 
   $R_HOME/lib to the list of linked files. For example:
    
   # crle -64 -c /var/ld/64/ld.config -l /lib/64:/usr/lib/64:/usr/sfw/lib/64:/usr/lib/64/R-2.6.1/lib/R/lib

   This must be done on all hosts in your Greenplum Database array.
