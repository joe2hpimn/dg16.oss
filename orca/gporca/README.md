Welcome to GPORCA, the Greenplum Next Generation Query Optimizer!

GPORCA supports various build types: debug, release with debug info, release.
On x86 systems, GPORCA can also be built as a 32-bit or 64-bit library. You'll
need CMake 3.0 or higher to build GPORCA. Get it from cmake.org, or your
operating system's package manager.

## Quick Start: Build GPORCA and install under /usr/local

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../
make
sudo make install
```

Or read on for more detailed instructions below...

## Pre-Requisites

GPORCA uses the following libraries:
1) GPOS - Greenplum's OS Abstraction Layer
2) GP-Xerces - Greenplum's patched version of Xerces-C 3.1.X

### Installing GPOS

[GPOS is available here](https://github.com/greenplum-db/gpos) The GPOS README
gives instructions for building and installing GPOS. Note that the build type
(e.g. DEBUG vs. RELEASE) for GPOS and GPORCA should match (mixing and matching
can lead to errors).

If GPOS was installed to the default location, the cmake build system for
GPORCA should find it automatically. Otherwise, cmake can be pointed to your
GPOS installation with the `GPOS_INCLUDE_DIR` and `GPOS_LIBRARY` options like
so:

```
cmake -D GPOS_INCLUDE_DIR=/opt/gpos/include -D GPOS_LIBRARY=/opt/gpos/lib/libgpos.so ..
```

Note that on Mac OS X, the library name will end with `.dylib` instead of `.so`.

### Installing GP-Xerces

To install GP-Xerces, obtain a copy of the
[Xerces-C source code](https://xerces.apache.org/xerces-c/download.cgi)
(versions 3.1.1 and 3.1.2 are tested and known to work) and apply the the GPDB
patchset (located at `patches/xerces-c-gpdb.patch` in the GP-Orca source tree)
before building. Presuming that you downloaded Xerces-C 3.1.2, a recipe for
building GP-Xerces would be something like the following:

```
wget http://www.trieuvan.com/apache//xerces/c/3/sources/xerces-c-3.1.2.tar.gz
tar -xzf xerces-c-3.1.2.tar.gz
cd xerces-c-3.1.2
patch -p1 < /path/to/orca/patches/xerces-c-gpdb.patch
mkdir build
cd build

# Use --prefix=/opt/gp_xerces if you don't want to override the default xerces
# However, this qp-xerces needs to be at default location /usr/local in order
# to build GPORCA
../configure 
make
sudo make install
```

It is recommended to use the `--prefix` option to the Xerces-C configure script
to install GP-Xerces in a location other than the default under `/usr/local/`,
because you may have other software that depends on Xerces-C, and the changes
introduced in the GP-Xerces patch make it incompatible with the upstream
version. Installing in a non-default prefix allows you to have GP-Xerces
installed side-by-side with unpatched Xerces without incompatibilities.

You can point cmake at your patched GP-Xerces installation using the
`XERCES_INCLUDE_DIR` and `XERCES_LIBRARY` options like so:

However, to use the current build scripts in GPDB, Xerces with the gp_xerces
patch will need to be placed on the /usr path.

```
cmake -D XERCES_INCLUDE_DIR=/opt/gp_xerces/include -D XERCES_LIBRARY=/opt/gp_xerces/lib/libxerces-c.so ..
```

Again, on Mac OS X, the library name will end with `.dylib` instead of `.so`.

**Advanced - Cross-compiling 32-bit or 64-bit libraries** Unless you intend to
cross-compile a 32 or 64-bit version of GP-Orca, you can ignore these
instructions. If you need to explicitly compile for the 32 or 64-bit version of
your architecture, you need to set the `CFLAGS` and `CXXFLAGS` environment
variables for the configure script like so (use `-m32` for 32-bit, `-m64` for
64-bit):

```
CFLAGS="-m32" CXXFLAGS="-m32" ../configure --prefix=/opt/gp_xerces_32
```

## Preperation for build


Go into gporca and create a build folder
```
mkdir build
cd build
```

### How to generate make files with default options
Please ensure that build type of GPOS matches the version of Optimizer libraries
you are trying to build. Mixing and matching a DEBUG GPOS with a RELEASE Orca or
vice-versa may cause problems.

* debug build

```
cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=DEBUG ../
```

* release build with debug info

```
cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo ../
```

* release build

```
cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE ../
```

## Explicitly Specifying GPOS and GP-Xerces For Build

As noted in the prerequisites section above, you may specify the
`GPOS_INCLUDE_DIR` and `GPOS_LIBRARY` options to tell cmake where to find
GPOS (or similarly with `XERCES_INCLUDE_DIR` and `XERCES_LIBRARY` for
GP-Xerces). These options are useful if GPOS/GP-Xerces is installed in a
nonstandard place, or if multiple versions are installed in different locations
(for instance DEBUG vs. RELEASE, or 32 vs. 64-bit builds).

For example:
```
cmake -D XERCES_INCLUDE_DIR=/opt/gp_xerces/include -D XERCES_LIBRARY=/opt/gp_xerces/lib/libxerces-c.so ../
```

## Advanced: Cross-Compiling 32-bit or 64-bit libraries

For the most part you should not need to explicitly compile a 32-bit or 64-bit
version of the optimizer libraries. By default, a "native" version for your host
platform will be compiled. However, if you are on x86 and want to, for example,
build a 32-bit version of Optimizer libraries on a 64-bit machine, you can do
so as described below. Note that you will need a "multilib" C++ compiler that
supports the -m32/-m64 switches, and you may also need to install 32-bit ("i386")
versions of the C and C++ standard libraries for your OS. Finally, you will need
to build 32-bit or 64-bit versions of GPOS and GP-Xerces as appropriate.

Toolchain files for building 32 or 64-bit x86 libraries are located in the cmake
directory. Here is an example of building for 32-bit x86:

```
cmake -D CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../cmake/i386.toolchain.cmake ../
```

And for 64-bit x86:

```
cmake -D CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../cmake/x86_64.toolchain.cmake ../
```

## How to build

* build

```
make
```

* for faster build use the -j option of make. For instance, the following command runs make on 7 job slots

```
make -j7
```

* show all commands being run as part of make

```
make VERBOSE=1
```

## How to test

To run all GPORCA tests, simply use the `ctest` command from the build directory
after `make` finishes.

```
ctest
```

Much like `make`, `ctest` has a -j option that allows running multiple tests in
parallel to save time. Using it is recommended for faster testing.

```
ctest -j7
```

By default, `ctest` does not print the output of failed tests. To print the
output of failed tests, use the `--output-on-failure` flag like so (this is
useful for debugging failed tests):

```
ctest -j7 --output-on-failure
```

To run a specific individual test, use the `gporca_test` executable directly.

```
./server/gporca_test -U CAggTest
```

Note that some tests use assertions that are only enabled for DEBUG builds, so
DEBUG-mode tests tend to be more rigorous.

### Advanced: Extended Tests

Debug builds of GPORCA include a couple of "extended" tests for features like
fault-simulation and time-slicing that work by running the entire test suite
in combination with the feature being tested. These tests can take a long time
to run and are not enabled by default. To turn extended tests on, add the cmake
arguments `-D ENABLE_EXTENDED_TESTS=1`.

## How to install

GPORCA has three libraries:

1. libnaucrates --- has all DXL related classes, and statistics related classes
2. libgpopt     --- has all the code related to the optimization engine, meta-data accessor, logical / physical operators,
                    transformation rules, and translators (DXL to expression and vice versa).
3. libgpdbcost  --- cost model for GPDB.

By default, GPORCA will be installed under /usr/local. You can change this by
setting CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX when running cmake, for example:
```
cmake -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/home/user/gporca ../
```

By default, the header files are located in:
```
/usr/local/include/naucrates
/usr/local/include/gpdbcost
/usr/local/include/gpopt
```
the library is located at:

```
/usr/local/lib/libnaucrates.so*
/usr/local/lib/libgpdbcost.so*
/usr/local/lib/libgpopt.so*
```

* build and install
```
make install
```
* build and install with verbose output
```
make VERBOSE=1 install
```

## Clean up stuff

* remove the cmake files generated under build

* Remove gporca header files and library, (assuming the default install prefix /usr/local)

```
rm -rf /usr/local/include/naucrates
rm -rf /usr/local/include/gpdbcost
rm -rf /usr/local/include/gpopt
rm -rf /usr/local/lib/libnaucrates.so*
rm -rf /usr/local/lib/libgpdbcost.so*
rm -rf /usr/local/lib/libgpopt.so*
```
