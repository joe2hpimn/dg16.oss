  # INPUT, OUTPUT, MAP, etc.

  # This is an input with invalid name ""

define:
    
  # This is an input with invalid name ""
  # The fourth case of bad indentation is an indentation level that is
  # 1) Less than the indentation of name, so it's not parsed as being
  #    in the name container, and
  # 2) Does not match any existing indendation
  #
  # Unlike the above errors this is actually an YAML syntax error,
  # which is a FATAL error that halts any further parsing of the document.
