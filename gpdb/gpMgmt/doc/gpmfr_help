COMMAND NAME: gpmfr

Manages the Greenplum Database backup images that are stored on a 
local Data Domain system and a remote Data Domain system that is used 
for disaster recovery. Managed file replication is used for disaster 
recovery by the Data Domain Boost software option to transfer a backup 
image from one Data Domain system to another.

*****************************************************
PREREQUISITES
*****************************************************

The Data Domain systems that are used as the local and remote backup 
systems for managed file replication must have Data Domain Boost 
enabled. 

The Greenplum Database master segment must be able to connect to both 
the local Data Domain system and the remote Data Domain system. 

See the Greenplum Database release notes for information about the 
supported version of Data Domain Boost. 

*****************************************************
DESCRIPTION
*****************************************************
 The gpmfr utility provides these capabilities: 

* Lists the backup data sets that are on the local or the remote
  Data Domain system. 

* Replicates a backup data set that is on the local Data Domain
  system to the remote system. 

* Recovers a backup data set that is on the remote Data Domain system
  to the local system. 

* Deletes a backup data set that is on the local or the remote 
  Data Domain system.

The Greenplum Database backup sets are identified by timestamps 
(yyyymmddhhmmss). 

gpmfr attempts to schedule the replication task for the files in backup 
data set. It ensures that the limit on the maximum number of I/O streams 
used for replication is never exceeded. The I/O streams limit is set 
with the --max-streams option that accompanies the --replicate or 
--recover option. 

When cancelling a replication operation, gpmfr kills all active 
replication processes and cleans up all the files on replication Data 
Domain system. 


*****************************************************
OPTIONS
*****************************************************

-a (do not prompt) 

 Do not prompt the user for confirmation. Progress information is 
 displayed on the output. Specify the option -q or --quiet to write 
 progress information to the log file. 


--delete {LATEST | OLDEST | <timestamp>}

 Deletes a Greenplum Database backup set from the local Data Domain 
 system. Specify the option --remote to delete the backup set from the 
 remote Data Domain system. 

 LATEST specifies deleting the latest backup set (first in chronological 
 order). 

 OLDEST specifies deleting the backup set that is oldest in chronological 
 order. 

 <timestamp> specifies deleting the Greenplum Database backup set 
 identified by the <timestamp>. 


--list

 Lists the Greenplum Database backup sets that are on the local Data 
 Domain system. The backup sets are identified by timestamps 
 (yyyymmddhhmmss). 
 
 Specify the option --remote to list the Greenplum Database backup sets 
 that are on the remote Data Domain system. 


--list-files {LATEST | OLDEST | <timestamp>}

 Lists the files in a Greenplum Database backup that is on the local Data 
 Domain system. Specify the option --remote to list the files in the 
 backup set that is on the remote Data Domain system. 

 LATEST specifies listing the files in the latest backup set (first in 
 chronological order). 

 OLDEST specifies listing the files in the backup set that is oldest in 
 chronological order. 

 <timestamp> specifies listing the file in the backup set identified by the 
 <timestamp>. 


--master-port=<master_port>

 Specifies the Greenplum Database master port number. To validate backup 
 sets, the utility retrieves information from the Greenplum Database 
 instance that uses the port number. If the option is not specified, the 
 default value is 5432. 

 If gpmfr does not find a Greenplum Database, validation is skipped and a 
 warning is displayed. 
 

--max-streams <max_IO_streams>

 Specifies the maximum number of Data Domain I/O streams that can be used
 when copying the backup set between the local and remote Data Domain 
 systems.


-q | --quiet (no screen output) 

 Runs in quiet mode. File transfer progress information is not displayed 
 on the output, it is written to the log file. If this option is not 
 specified, progress information is only displayed on screen, it is not 
 written to the log file. 


--recover {LATEST | OLDEST | <timestamp>} 

 Recovers a Greenplum Database backup set that is available on the remote 
 Data Domain system to the local system. 

 LATEST specifies recovering the most recent backup set (first in 
 chronological order). 

 OLDEST specifies recovering the backup set that is oldest in 
 chronological order. 

 <timestamp> specifies recovering the backup set identified by the 
 <timestamp>. 

 If a backup set with the same <timestamp> exists on local Data Domain 
 system, the utility prompts you to confirm replacing the backup. 

 A progress bar indicating transfer status of the backup set is shown on 
 shown at the output. 


--replicate {LATEST | OLDEST | <timestamp>} 

 Replicates a Greenplum Database backup set that is on the local Data 
 Domain system to the remote system. 

 LATEST specifies replicating the most recent backup set (first in 
 chronological order). 

 OLDEST specifies replicating the backup set that is oldest in 
 chronological order. 

 <timestamp> specifies replicating the backup set identified by the 
 <timestamp>. 

 If a backup set with the same <timestamp> exists on remote Data Domain 
 system, the utility prompts you to confirm replacing the backup. 

 A progress bar indicating transfer status of the backup set is shown at 
 the output. 

 Note: A backup set must be completely backed up to the local Domain 
 system before it can be replicated to the remote Data Domain system. 


--remote 

 Perform the operation on the remote Data Domain system that is used for 
 disaster recovery. 

 For example, gpmfr --list lists the backup sets that are on the local 
 Data Domain system that is used to back up Greenplum Database. 
 gpmfr --list --remote lists the backup sets that are on the remote system. 


--show-streams 

 Displays the replication I/O stream soft limit and the number of I/O 
 streams that are in use. 

 
--skip-ping 

 Specify this option to skip the ping of a Data Domain system. gpmfr uses 
 ping to ensure that the Data Domain system is reachable. If the Data 
 Domain host is configured to block ICMP ping probes, specify this option 
 to skip the ping of the Data Domain system. 

 
-h | --help

 Displays the online help. 

 
-v | --verbose 

 Specifies verbose logging mode. Additional log information is written to 
 the log file during command execution. 


--version 

 Displays the version of this utility. 


*****************************************************
EXAMPLE
*****************************************************

The following example replicates the latest backup set on the local Data 
Domain sever to the remote server. The maximium number of I/O streams 
that can be used for the replication is 30. 

gpmfr --replicate LATEST --max-streams 30
