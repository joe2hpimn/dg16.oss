ABOUT GP DEMO
******************************************************************

The GP demo program will setup a virtual Greenplum Database system on a 
single host. It creates and starts a GP master instance and three 
segment instances within the same directory. Running GP demo is a good 
way to test your initial installation before deploying the Greenplum Database 
software on a multi-host array. It is also a good way to become familiar 
with the system without investing the time involved in a multi-host setup.

******************************************************************
BEFORE YOU BEGIN
******************************************************************

Before running GP demo, you must at least 110 MB of free disk space, 
and have ports 18501, 18506, 18507, and 18508 free.

PREREQUISITES FOR SOLARIS USERS

* Make sure that make, tar, and a C compiler (gcc recommended) 
  is in your $PATH. 

* Verify that your $USER environment variable is set. 

* Greenplum recommends using the bash shell to run the GP demo programs.

******************************************************************
RUNNING GP DEMO
******************************************************************

1. Login as the Greenplum designated user (i.e. 'bgadmin').

	su - bgadmin

2. Go to the directory where you wish to unpack and run the Greenplum demo 
   program. This directory should have at least 110 MB of free space.

3. Unzip and untar gpdemo:

	tar -xvzf $GPHOME/gpMgmt/demo/gpdemo.tar.gz

4. Go into the gpdemo directory you just untarred:

	cd gpdemo

5. Run make:

	make

6. If setup completes correctly, you will have a virtual Greenplum Database 
   system running on the local host. You can connect to it using the 
   psql client program as follows:

	psql template1 -p 18501

7. To exit the psql client program:

	\q

8. See the Greenplum Database User Guide for more information on using 
   your Greenplum Database system.


******************************************************************
REMOVING GP DEMO
******************************************************************

1. From the gpdemo directory run make clean:

	make clean

2. This will stop all Greenplum Database demo server processes and remove all 
   files and directories created by the GP demo program.
