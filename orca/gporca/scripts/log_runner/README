Steps to run the installcheck workload:
1. install gpplanfreezer using make install in the gpplanfreezer directory
2. create a database called 'regression'
3. run setup.sql against the 'regression' database 
   psql regression -a -f setup.sql
   This creates a bunch of UDFs and views. The important ones are stmts, dxl_tests and scoreboard
4. run installcheck workload as
   psql regression -a -f installcheck-workload.sql 
5. Tally the scoreboard by logging into the db and typing
   	 select * from dxl_scoreboard
   You can drill down to individual test cases by doing
       select * from dxl_tests

     transform_log.pl which was used to produce installcheck-workload.sql

TODO:
	Add algebrizer test generation once UDFs become available
