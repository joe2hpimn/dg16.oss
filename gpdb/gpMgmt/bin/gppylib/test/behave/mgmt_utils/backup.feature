    @filter
    @slb
    Scenario: Incremental Backup and Restore with -S filter for Full
        Given the database is running
        And the prefix "foo" is stored
        And there are no backup files
        And the database "fullbkdb" does not exist
        And database "fullbkdb" exists
        And there is a list to store the incremental backup timestamps
        And there is schema "schema_heap, schema_ao, schema_heap1" exists in "fullbkdb"
        And there is a "heap" table "schema_heap.heap_table1" with compression "None" in "fullbkdb" with data
        And there is a "heap" table "schema_heap1.heap_table2" with compression "None" in "fullbkdb" with data

        And there is a "ao" partition table "schema_ao.ao_part_table" with compression "quicklz" in "fullbkdb" with data
        And there is a table-file "/tmp/schema_file" with tables "schema_heap1,schema_heap"
        When the user runs "gpcrondump -a -x fullbkdb --prefix=foo -S schema_heap1 -S schema_heap"
        Then gpcrondump should return a return code of 0
        And the timestamp from gpcrondump is stored
        And the full backup timestamp from gpcrondump is stored 
        And "_filter" file should be created under " "
        And verify that the "filter" file in " " dir contains "schema_ao.ao_index_table"
        And there is a "heap" table "schema_heap.heap_table2" with compression "None" in "fullbkdb" with data
        And table "schema_ao.ao_part_table" is assumed to be in dirty state in "fullbkdb"
        And table "schema_ao.ao_index_table" is dropped in "fullbkdb"
        When the user runs "gpcrondump -a -x fullbkdb --prefix=foo --incremental"
        Then gpcrondump should return a return code of 0 
        And the timestamp from gpcrondump is stored
        And the timestamp from gpcrondump is stored in a list
        And all the data from "fullbkdb" is saved for verification
        And the user runs "psql -c 'drop table schema_ao.ao_part_table' fullbkdb"
        When the user runs "gpdbrestore --prefix=foo -a" with the stored timestamp
        Then gpdbrestore should return a return code of 0 
        And verify that there is a "heap" table "schema_heap.heap_table1" in "fullbkdb" with data
        And verify that there is a "heap" table "schema_heap.heap_table2" in "fullbkdb" with data
        And verify that there is no table "schema_ao.ao_index_table" in "fullbkdb"
        And verify that there is a "ao" table "schema_ao.ao_part_table" in "fullbkdb" with data

    Scenario: pg_dump correctly backup aggregate functions
        Given the user runs "deletedb test_pg_dump; createdb test_pg_dump"
        And the user runs "psql -f gppylib/test/behave/mgmt_utils/steps/data/pg_dump_function_test.sql test_pg_dump"
        When the user runs "pg_dump -s -n public -f /tmp/public_pg_dump_ddl.dmp test_pg_dump"
        Then verify that function is backedup correctly in "/tmp/public_pg_dump_ddl.dmp"

    # THIS SHOULD BE THE LAST TEST
    @backupfire
    Scenario: cleanup for backup feature
        Given the backup files in "/tmp" are deleted
