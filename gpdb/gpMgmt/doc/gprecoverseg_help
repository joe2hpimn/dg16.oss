DESCRIPTION
******************************************************

In a system with mirrors enabled, the gprecoverseg utility reactivates 
a failed segment instance and identifies the changed database files 
that require resynchronization. Once gprecoverseg completes this 
process, the system goes into resyncronizing mode until the recovered 
segment is brought up to date. The system is online and fully 
operational during resyncronization.

A segment instance can fail for several reasons, such as a host failure, 
network failure, or disk failure. When a segment instance fails, its 
status is marked as down in the Greenplum Database system catalog, 
and its mirror is activated in change tracking mode. In order to 
bring the failed segment instance back into operation again, you 
must first correct the problem that made it fail in the first place, 
and then recover the segment instance in Greenplum Database 
using gprecoverseg.

Segment recovery using gprecoverseg requires that you have an active 
mirror to recover from. For systems that do not have mirroring enabled, 
or in the event of a double fault (a primary and mirror pair both down 
at the same time) — do a system restart to bring the segments back 
online (gpstop -r).

By default, a failed segment is recovered in place, meaning that 
the system brings the segment back online on the same host and data 
directory location on which it was originally configured. In 
this case, use the following format for the recovery configuration file 
(using -i).

filespaceOrder=[filespace1_fsname[, filespace2_fsname[, ...]]
<failed_host_address>:<port>:<data_directory> 

In some cases, this may not be possible (for example, if a host was 
physically damaged and cannot be recovered). In this situation, 
gprecoverseg allows you to recover failed segments to a completely 
new host (using -p), on an alternative data directory location on 
your remaining live segment hosts (using -s), or by supplying a 
recovery configuration file (using -i) in the following format. 
The word SPACE indicates the location of a required space. Do not 
add additional spaces.

filespaceOrder=[filespace1_fsname[, filespace2_fsname[, ...]]
<failed_host_address>:<port>:<data_directory>SPACE 
[<recovery_host_address>:<port>:<replication_port>:<data_directory>
[:<fselocation>:...]]

See the -i option below for details and examples of a recovery
configuration file.

The gp_segment_configuration, pg_filespace, and pg_filespace_entry 
system catalog tables can help you determine your current segment 
configuration so that you can plan your mirror recovery configuration. 
For example, run the following query:

=# SELECT dbid, content, address, port, 
   replication_port, fselocation as datadir 
   FROM gp_segment_configuration, pg_filespace_entry 
   WHERE dbid=fsedbid 
   ORDER BY dbid;

The new recovery segment host must be pre-installed with the Greenplum 
Database software and configured exactly the same as the existing 
segment hosts. A spare data directory location must exist on all 
currently configured segment hosts and have enough disk space to 
accommodate the failed segments.

The recovery process marks the segment as up again in the Greenplum 
Database system catalog, and then initiates the resyncronization 
process to bring the transactional state of the segment 
up-to-date with the latest changes. The system is online 
and available during resyncronization. To check the status 
of the resyncronization process run:

gpstate -m

If you do not have mirroring enabled or if you have both a 
primary and its mirror down, you must take manual steps to 
recover the failed segment instances and then restart the 
system, for example:

gpstop -r

******************************************************
OPTIONS
******************************************************

-a (do not prompt)

Do not prompt the user for confirmation.


-B parallel_processes

The number of segments to recover in parallel. If not specified, 
the utility will start up to four parallel processes depending 
on how many segment instances it needs to recover.


-d master_data_directory

Optional. The master host data directory. If not specified, 
the value set for $MASTER_DATA_DIRECTORY will be used.


-F (full recovery)

Optional. Perform a full copy of the active segment instance 
in order to recover the failed segment. The default is to 
only copy over the incremental changes that occurred while 
the segment was down.


-i <recover_config_file>

Specifies the name of a file with the details about failed segments to recover. 
Each line in the file is in the following format. The word SPACE indicates 
the location of a required space. Do not add additional spaces.

filespaceOrder=[filespace1_fsname[, filespace2_fsname[, ...]]
<failed_host_address>:<port>:<data_directory>SPACE
<recovery_host_address>:<port>:<replication_port>:<data_directory>[:<fselocation>:...]

Comments
Lines beginning with # are treated as comments and ignored.

Filespace Order
The first comment line that is not a comment specifies filespace ordering. 
This line starts with filespaceOrder= and is followed by list of filespace 
names delimited by a colon. For example:

filespaceOrder=raid1:raid2

The default pg_system filespace should not appear in this list. The 
list should be left empty on a system with no filespaces other than 
the default pg_system filespace. For example:

filespaceOrder=

Segments to Recover
Each line after the first specifies a segment to recover. This line can 
have one of two formats. In the event of in-place recovery, enter one 
group of colon delimited fields in the line:

failedAddress:failedPort:failedDataDirectory

For recovery to a new location, enter two groups of fields separated by 
a space in the line. The required space is indicated by SPACE. Do not 
add additional spaces.

failedAddress:failedPort:failedDataDirectorySPACEnewAddress:newPort:
newReplicationPort:newDataDirectory

On a system with additional filespaces, the second group of fields 
is expected to be followed with a list of the corresponding filespace 
locations separated by additional colons. For example, on a system 
with two additional filespaces, enter two additional directories 
in the second group, as follows. The required space is indicated 
by SPACE. Do not add additional spaces.

failedAddress:failedPort:failedDataDirectory newAddress:newPort:
newReplicationPort:newDataDirectory:location1:location2

Examples

In-place recovery of a single mirror

filespaceOrder=
sdw1-1:50001:/data1/mirror/gpseg16

Recovery of a single mirror to a new host

filespaceOrder=
sdw1-1:50001:/data1/mirror/gpseg16SPACE sdw4-1:50001:51001:/data1/recover1/gpseg16

Recovery of a single mirror to a new host on a system with an extra filespace

filespaceOrder=fs1
sdw1-1:50001:/data1/mirror/gpseg16SPACE sdw4-1:50001:51001:/data1/recover1
/gpseg16:/data1/fs1/gpseg16

Obtaining a Sample File

You can use the -o option to output a sample recovery configuration file 
to use as a starting point.

-l <logfile_directory>

The directory to write the log file. Defaults to ~/gpAdminLogs.

-o <output_recover_config_file>

Specifies a file name and location to output a sample 
recovery configuration file. The output file lists the 
currently invalid segments and their default recovery 
location in the format that is required by the -i option. 
Use together with the -p option to output a sample file 
for recovering to a different host. This file can be 
edited to supply alternate recovery locations if needed.


-p <new_recover_host>[,...]

Specifies a spare host outside of the currently configured 
Greenplum Database array on which to recover invalid segments. In 
the case of multiple failed segment hosts, you can specify a 
comma-separated list. The spare host must have the Greenplum Database 
software installed and configured, and have the same hardware and OS 
configuration as the current segment hosts (same OS version, locales, 
gpadmin user account, data directory locations created, ssh keys 
exchanged, number of network interfaces, network interface naming 
convention, and so on.).


-q (no screen output)

Run in quiet mode. Command output is not displayed on 
the screen, but is still written to the log file.


-r (rebalance segments)

After a segment recovery, segment instances may not be returned to the 
preferred role that they were given at system initialization time. This 
can leave the system in a potentially unbalanced state, as some segment 
hosts may have more active segments than is optimal for top system performance. 
This option rebalances primary and mirror segments by returning them to 
their preferred roles. All segments must be valid and synchronized before 
running gprecoverseg -r. If there are any in progress queries, they will 
be cancelled and rolled back.


-s <filespace_config_file>

Specifies the name of a configuration file that contains file 
system locations on the currently configured segment hosts 
where you can recover failed segment instances. The filespace 
configuration file is in the format of:

pg_system=default_fselocation 
filespace1_name=filespace1_fselocation
filespace2_name=filespace2_fselocation
...

If your system does not have additional filespaces configured, 
this file will only have one location (for the default filespace, 
pg_system). These file system locations must exist on all segment 
hosts in the array and have sufficient disk space to accommodate 
recovered segments.
Note: The -s and -S options are only used when you recover to 
existing hosts in the cluster. You cannot use these options 
when you recover to a new host. To recover to a new host, 
use the -i and -o options.

-S <output_filespace_config_file>

Specifies a file name and location to output a sample 
filespace configuration file in the format that is 
required by the -s option. This file should be edited 
to supply the correct alternate filespace locations.

-v (verbose)

Sets logging output to verbose.

--version (version)

Displays the version of this utility.

-? (help)
Displays the online help.
