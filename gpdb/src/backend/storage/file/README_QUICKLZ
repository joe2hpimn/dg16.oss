QUICKLZ COMPRESSION LIBRARIES
==============================

QuickLZ 1.4.0 comes out of the box as a set of two files:
 - quicklz.c
 - quicklz.h
 
The library file includes a set of pre-compiled options, one of which is
of interest to us: QLZ_COMPRESSION_LEVEL. Level 1 gives the fastest compression 
speed while level 3 gives the fastest decompression speed. 

Quicklz state that: "Because of performance reasons these settings cannot be 
specified dynamically at runtime. They must be specified in the beginning of the 
quicklz.h file whereafter the library must be compiled.Ó

Therefore, in order to be able to support dynamically selecting a compression 
level (values 1 or 3) we decided to create 2 sets of files that are pre compiled
one for compression level 1 and another for compression level 3. we changed the
API in each of them to include only values and function calls relevant to the
specific compression level.

compression level 1 must use the functions and constants from here:
 - quicklz1.c
 - quicklz1.h

compression level 3 must use the functions and constants from here:
 - quicklz3.c
 - quicklz3.h

Practically this means that there are 3 types of compressors in GPDB at this
moment:

 1) zlib (with levels 1 - 9)
 2) quicklz with level 1
 3) quicklz with level 3
