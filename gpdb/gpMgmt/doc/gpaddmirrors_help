*****************************************************
DESCRIPTION
*****************************************************
The gpaddmirrors utility configures mirror segment instances for an 
existing Greenplum Database system that was initially configured with 
primary segment instances only. The utility will create the mirror 
instances and begin the online replication process between the primary 
and mirror segment instances. Once all mirrors are synchronized with 
their primaries, your Greenplum Database system is fully data redundant.

IMPORTANT: During the online replication process, Greenplum Database 
should be in a quiescent state, workloads and other queries should not 
be running. 

By default, the utility will prompt you for the file system location(s) 
where it will create the mirror segment data directories. If you do not 
want to be prompted, you can pass in a file containing the file system 
locations using the -m option.

The mirror locations and ports must be different than your primary 
segment data locations and ports. If you have created additional filespaces, 
you will also be prompted for mirror locations for each of your filespaces.

The utility will create a unique data directory for each mirror segment 
instance in the specified location using the predefined naming convention. 
There must be the same number of file system locations declared for mirror 
segment instances as for primary segment instances. It is OK to specify 
the same directory name multiple times if you want your mirror data 
directories created in the same location, or you can enter a different 
data location for each mirror. Enter the absolute path. For example:

Enter mirror segment data directory location 1 of 2 > /gpdb/mirror
Enter mirror segment data directory location 2 of 2 > /gpdb/mirror
OR
Enter mirror segment data directory location 1 of 2 > /gpdb/m1
Enter mirror segment data directory location 2 of 2 > /gpdb/m2

Alternatively, you can run the gpaddmirrors utility and supply a 
detailed configuration file using the -i option. This is useful if 
you want your mirror segments on a completely different set of hosts 
than your primary segments. The format of the mirror configuration file is:

filespaceOrder=[<filespace1_fsname>[:<filespace2_fsname>:...]
mirror<content>=<content>:<address>:<port>:<mir_replication_port>:<pri_replication_port>:<fselocation>[:<fselocation>:...]

For example (if you do not have additional filespaces configured 
besides the default pg_system filespace):

filespaceOrder=
mirror0=0:sdw1-1:60000:61000:62000:/gpdata/mir1/gp0
mirror1=1:sdw1-1:60001:61001:62001:/gpdata/mir2/gp1

The gp_segment_configuration, pg_filespace, and pg_filespace_entry 
system catalog tables can help you determine your current primary 
segment configuration so that you can plan your mirror segment 
configuration. For example, run the following query:

=# SELECT dbid, content, address as host_address, port, 
   replication_port, fselocation as datadir 
   FROM gp_segment_configuration, pg_filespace_entry 
   WHERE dbid=fsedbid 
   ORDER BY dbid;

If creating your mirrors on alternate mirror hosts, the new 
mirror segment hosts must be pre-installed with the Greenplum 
Database software and configured exactly the same as the 
existing primary segment hosts. 

You must make sure that the user who runs gpaddmirrors (the 
gpadmin user) has permissions to write to the data directory 
locations specified. You may want to create these directories 
on the segment hosts and chown them to the appropriate user 
before running gpaddmirrors.


*****************************************************
OPTIONS
*****************************************************

-a (do not prompt)

 Run in quiet mode - do not prompt for information. Must supply 
 a configuration file with either -m or -i if this option is used.


-B <parallel_processes>

 The number of mirror setup processes to start in parallel. If 
 not specified, the utility will start up to 10 parallel processes 
 depending on how many mirror segment instances it needs to set up.


-d <master_data_directory>

 The master data directory. If not specified, the value set for 
 $MASTER_DATA_DIRECTORY will be used.


-i <mirror_config_file>

 A configuration file containing one line for each mirror segment 
 you want to create. You must have one mirror segment listed for 
 each primary segment in the system. The format of this file is as 
 follows (as per attributes in the gp_segment_configuration, 
 pg_filespace, and pg_filespace_entry catalog tables):

   filespaceOrder=[<filespace1_fsname>[:<filespace2_fsname>:...]
   mirror<content>=<content>:<address>:<port>:<mir_replication_port>:<pri_replication_port>:<fselocation>[:<fselocation>:...]

 Note that you only need to specify a name for filespaceOrder if 
 your system has multiple filespaces configured. If your system does 
 not have additional filespaces configured besides the default pg_system 
 filespace, this file will only have one location per segment (for 
 the default data directory filespace, pg_system). pg_system does 
 not need to be listed in the filespaceOrder line. It will always be 
 the first <fselocation> listed after <replication_port>.


-l <logfile_directory>

 The directory to write the log file. Defaults to ~/gpAdminLogs.


-m <datadir_config_file>

 A configuration file containing a list of file system locations where 
 the mirror data directories will be created. If not supplied, the 
 utility will prompt you for locations. Each line in the file specifies 
 a mirror data directory location. For example:
   /gpdata/m1
   /gpdata/m2
   /gpdata/m3
   /gpdata/m4
 If your system has additional filespaces configured in addition to the 
 default pg_system filespace, you must also list file system locations 
 for each filespace as follows:
    filespace filespace1
    /gpfs1/m1
    /gpfs1/m2
    /gpfs1/m3
    /gpfs1/m4


-o <output_sample_mirror_config>

 If you are not sure how to lay out the mirror configuration file 
 used by the -i option, you can run gpaddmirrors with this option 
 to generate a sample mirror configuration file based on your 
 primary segment configuration. The utility will prompt you for 
 your mirror segment data directory locations (unless you provide 
 these in a file using -m). You can then edit this file to change 
 the host names to alternate mirror hosts if necessary.


-p <port_offset>

 Optional. This number is used to calculate the database ports 
 and replication ports used for mirror segments. The default offset 
 is 1000. Mirror port assignments are calculated as follows: 
	primary port + offset = mirror database port
	primary port + (2 * offset) = mirror replication port
	primary port + (3 * offset) = primary replication port
 For example, if a primary segment has port 50001, then its mirror 
 will use a database port of 51001, a mirror replication port of 
 52001, and a primary replication port of 53001 by default.


-s (spread mirrors)

 Spreads the mirror segments across the available hosts. The 
 default is to group a set of mirror segments together on an 
 alternate host from their primary segment set. Mirror spreading 
 will place each mirror on a different host within the Greenplum 
 Database array. Spreading is only allowed if there is a sufficient 
 number of hosts in the array (number of hosts is greater than 
 or equal to the number of segment instances per host).


-v (verbose)

 Sets logging output to verbose.


--version (show utility version)

 Displays the version of this utility.


-? (help)

 Displays the online help.


*****************************************************
EXAMPLES
*****************************************************

Add mirroring to an existing Greenplum Database system using 
the same set of hosts as your primary data. Calculate the mirror 
database and replication ports by adding 100 to the current 
primary segment port numbers:

  $ gpaddmirrors -p 100


Add mirroring to an existing Greenplum Database system using a 
different set of hosts from your primary data:

$ gpaddmirrors -i mirror_config_file

Where the mirror_config_file looks something like this (if you do not 
have additional filespaces configured besides the default pg_system 
filespace):

filespaceOrder=
mirror0=0:sdw1-1:52001:53001:54001:/gpdata/mir1/gp0
mirror1=1:sdw1-2:52002:53002:54002:/gpdata/mir2/gp1
mirror2=2:sdw2-1:52001:53001:54001:/gpdata/mir1/gp2
mirror3=3:sdw2-2:52002:53002:54002:/gpdata/mir2/gp3


Output a sample mirror configuration file to use with gpaddmirrors -i:

  $ gpaddmirrors -o /home/gpadmin/sample_mirror_config
