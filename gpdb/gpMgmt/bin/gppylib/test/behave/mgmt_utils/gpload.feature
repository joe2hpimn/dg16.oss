Feature: gpload tests

    Scenario: gpload without -l option should create log file in default location 
        Given the database is running
        And the database "testdb" does not exist
        And database "testdb" exists
        And there is a "heap" table "t1" with compression "None" in "testdb" with data
        And the user truncates "public.t1" tables in "testdb"
        And the gpAdminLogs directory has been backed up
        When the user runs "gpload -f gppylib/test/behave/mgmt_utils/steps/data/gpload_ctl_fmt.yml" 
        Then gpload should return a return code of 0
        And the "directory" path "~/gpAdminLogs" should " " exist
        And the directory "~/gpAdminLogs" is removed

    Scenario: multiple gpload instances on the same target table using "reuse_tables" won't truncate each other.
