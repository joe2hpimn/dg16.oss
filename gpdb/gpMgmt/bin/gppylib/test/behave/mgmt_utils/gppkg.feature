Feature: gppkg tests

    Scenario: gppkg -u should prompt user when package is updated with -a option
        Given the database is running
        When the user runs "gppkg -u foo.gppkg -a"
        Then gppkg should return a return code of 2
        And gppkg should print WARNING: The process of updating a package includes removing all to stdout
        And gppkg should print previous versions of the system objects related to the package. For to stdout
        And gppkg should print example, previous versions of shared libraries are removed. to stdout
        And gppkg should print After the update process, a database function will fail when it is to stdout
        And gppkg should print called if the function references a package file that has been removed. to stdout
        And gppkg should print Cannot find package foo.gppkg to stdout
        And gppkg should not print Do you still want to continue ? to stdout

    Scenario: gppkg -u should prompt user when package is updated with yes as input
        Given the database is running
        When the user runs "gppkg -u foo.gppkg < gppylib/test/behave/mgmt_utils/steps/data/yes.txt"
        Then gppkg should return a return code of 2
