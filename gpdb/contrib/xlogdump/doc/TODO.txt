Todo list for xlogdump:

* Refactor and cleanup code
* Try to reuse more backend code as much as possible
* Decode more types (arrays)
* Remove necessity of database connection for decoding statements and names translations
* Output DDL statements
* Make xlogviewer module work with the xlogdump program, to make possible query the logs within a running cluster
